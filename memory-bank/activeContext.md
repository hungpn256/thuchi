# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Implemented refresh token authentication system in both the API and web application
- Enhancing transaction management functionality
- Improving UI components
- Fixing UI interaction issues in forms and dialogs

## Recent Changes

- Added refresh token functionality with token rotation for enhanced security
- Added automatic token refresh on 401 errors in the web application
- Configured different expiry times for access tokens (15m) and refresh tokens (7d)
- Added comprehensive documentation for the authentication system
- Fixed issue in transaction form where category and date selection dropdowns weren't working properly in create mode
- Improved UI responsiveness with proper z-index configurations
- Consolidated transaction create and edit dialogs into a single reusable component
- Added padding to the transaction page for improved visual spacing
- Implemented proper event handling in popover components

## Active Decisions

1. Architecture

   - Monorepo structure for better code sharing
   - Separation of concerns between web and api
   - Type-safe development with TypeScript

2. UI/UX

   - Neumorphism design system
   - Dark mode support
   - Component-based architecture with shadcn
   - Consistent spacing and padding across pages

3. Authentication

   - JWT for both access and refresh tokens for simplicity
   - Tokens managed in memory rather than the database for better performance
   - Automatic token refresh when API requests return 401 Unauthorized
   - Access tokens have a short lifespan (15m) to minimize security risks
   - Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan (7d) to improve user experience

4. Development Workflow
   - Yarn for package management
   - ESLint and TypeScript for code quality
   - Git workflow with feature branches
   - DRY principles for dialog implementations

## Next Steps

1. Frontend

   - Improve form validation feedback
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Add transaction filtering capabilities
   - Implement additional transaction analytics

2. Backend

   - Consider implementing more advanced security features like token revocation
   - Add support for multiple devices with unique refresh tokens
   - Implement secure storage options (like HttpOnly cookies) for tokens in production
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Optimize transaction queries
   - Implement batch operations for transactions
   - Add advanced filtering options

3. Development Environment
   - Continue refining component reusability
   - Address any remaining UI inconsistencies
   - Review performance of data-heavy components

## Current Considerations

1. Technical

   - Type safety across frontend and backend
   - Performance optimization for transaction listings
   - z-index management in overlapping UI components
   - Event propagation handling in nested components
   - Secure token storage and automatic refresh mechanisms

2. UI/UX

   - Consistent padding and spacing standards
   - Dialog and modal interaction patterns
   - Form component behavior standardization
   - Mobile-friendly dropdowns and popovers
   - Seamless authentication experience with automatic token refresh

3. Development
   - Code reuse strategies for similar dialogs
   - Standard pattern for form state management
   - Consistent error handling in forms
   - Standardized authentication flow across the application
