# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Initial project setup and documentation
- Establishing project structure and patterns
- Setting up development environment

## Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank documentation
- Initialized project structure
- Set up monorepo with web and api workspaces

## Active Decisions

1. Architecture

   - Monorepo structure for better code sharing
   - Separation of concerns between web and api
   - Type-safe development with TypeScript

2. UI/UX

   - Neumorphism design system
   - Dark mode support
   - Component-based architecture with shadcn

3. Development Workflow
   - Yarn for package management
   - ESLint and TypeScript for code quality
   - Git workflow with feature branches

## Next Steps

1. Frontend

   - Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
   - Configure Tailwind CSS
   - Implement base UI components

2. Backend

   - Set up NestJS project
   - Configure database connection
   - Create initial API endpoints

3. Development Environment
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up testing framework
   - Configure build process

## Current Considerations

1. Technical

   - Type safety across frontend and backend
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Code reuse between workspaces

2. UI/UX

   - Component library structure
   - Theme implementation
   - Responsive design approach

3. Development
   - Code review process
   - Testing strategy
   - Documentation standards
