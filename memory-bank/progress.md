# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project initialization and structure
- Core UI components using shadcn
- Authentication system with refresh token mechanism
- Transaction listing and management
- Category management
- Basic filtering by date range
- Dark mode theming

## Recent Improvements

1. Authentication Enhancements
   - Implemented refresh token mechanism in the API
   - Added automatic token refresh in the web application
   - Implemented token rotation for better security
   - Added comprehensive documentation for the auth system
   - Created request queue mechanism for concurrent requests during token refresh

## In Progress

1. UI Enhancements

   - Improving form interactions
   - Fixing z-index issues in nested components
   - Optimizing mobile layouts
   - Standardizing padding and spacing

2. Transaction Management

   - Enhancing transaction form UX
   - Consolidating create/edit dialogs
   - Improving category selection
   - Date picker functionality fixes

3. Performance Optimization
   - Reducing unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimizing component memoization
   - Improving large dataset handling

## What's Left

1. Authentication Enhancements

   - Token revocation mechanism for logout
   - Multiple device support with unique refresh tokens
   - Secure storage options (HttpOnly cookies)
   - Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

2. Advanced Features

   - Advanced transaction filtering
   - Batch operations for transactions
   - Export/import functionality
   - Data visualization enhancements

3. User Experience

   - Guided tours/onboarding
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Animation refinements

4. Infrastructure
   - Advanced caching strategies
   - Offline support
   - Performance monitoring
   - Progressive Web App capabilities

## Known Issues

- Some z-index conflicts in nested dialogs and popovers
- Event propagation issues in complex nested components
- Minor padding inconsistencies across pages
- Mobile responsiveness improvements needed for some components

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Phase 1: Core Experience (Complete)

   - Authentication with refresh token
   - Basic transaction management
   - Category management
   - Simple reporting

2. Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience (In Progress)

   - Improved form interactions
   - Consolidated dialogs
   - Standardized spacing and padding
   - Mobile optimization

3. Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
   - Advanced reporting
   - Data visualization
   - Export/import
   - Offline capabilities

## Notes

- Focus on improving user experience in transaction management
- Addressing UI interaction bugs, particularly in forms and dialogs
- Following DRY principles for dialog management
- Implementing consistent handling of z-index and event propagation
- Enhanced security with refresh token implementation
